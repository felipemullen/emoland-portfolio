Back in the 90s, personal websites were all over the place. I have fond memories of waiting tens of seconds for a single page to load on our home dial-up connection. The reward was a plethora of wondrous and strange ideas that some basement nerd cobbled up together to proudly show to the world.

Today I launched this site, and although I may be turning into a basement nerd myself, I hope it will bring some joy to others as well.

There isn't all that much to see yet, but I will be adding lots of content in the next few weeks. How many years it took me to finally get this done!
